Tiny native AWS Custom Lambda Runtime which fulfills your needs!

## What it does?
It allows you to write one code which might run either on Official Java AWS Runtime (if you don't care about speed or you want to test your lambdas)
or on Native Custom AWS Runtime built into your codebase.

[Jump here](https://cljdoc.org/d/fierycod/holy-lambda/CURRENT/doc/1-01-installation) to learn more and start the journey with the Holy Lambda.

## Quickstart
Copy one of the examples. Library still in development
  
## Developer documentation
## Install library locally

```

``` clojure
lein with-profile +eftest eftest 
```
