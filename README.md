Tiny native AWS Custom Lambda Runtime which fulfills your needs!

## What it does?
It allows you to write one code which might run either on Official Java AWS Runtime (if you don't care about speed or you want to test your lambdas)
or on Native Custom AWS Runtime built into your codebase.

## Prerequisites
You will need following things to start:
- Node.js >= v8.9.0
- Java >= 8
- Docker, Docker Compose >= 1.13.1, 1.22.0
- Python, Pip >= 3.5.0, 8.9.0

The last step is to install `fnative` which is a tiny wrapper which builds the `.jar` using `GraalVM` and outputs the binary in your project
1. Install `fnative` in your path.
   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FieryCod/holy-lambda/master/resources/fnative && chmod +x fnative && sudo mv fnative /usr/local/bin
   ```
2. Copy `hello-lambda` from the examples and you have everything to experiment

## Installation
Add the following to your `:dependencies` in `project.clj`:

  ```
  [fierycod/holy-lambda "0.0.1"]
  ```
